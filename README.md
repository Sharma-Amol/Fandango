# Fandango – Is there a conflict of interest for a website that both sells movie tickets and display review ratings?

## Code

## Context
If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? *Especially* if the same company showing the rating *also* makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?

FiveThirtyEight published an [article](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) alleging that 'It seemed nearly impossible for a movie to fail by Fandango’s standards'. Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.The relevant data is  openly available on 538's github: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data. 

The goal of this project is to ask the right questions and use data manipulation to get relevant answers and see if we can reach a similar conclusion.
